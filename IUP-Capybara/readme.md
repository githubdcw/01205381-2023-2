## Design a PCB LC Filter

## Procedure

### 1. Take the Electrical Length, Impedance, and Frequency obtained from the calculations in Excel for a 9th order Equal-Ripple Low-Pass Filter Prototype, and use them to create components in the Sonnet program by determining the sizes from the TX line.

### Determine the sizes from TX line,

### 2. Design the model in Sonnet by following the data that we calculate in TXline.

### 3. Then we will get the graph from the model as shown in the picture below.

### 4. When we have the desired graph, we then take the model through Sonnet to be drawn into EasyEDA in order to proceed with ordering the actual product.

## Conclusion

The design and implementation of a low-pass filter followed by the PCB layout using TxLine and EasyEDA, They have different results due to the error from the design. However the design of EasyEDA is also designed to be suitable for actual use.
